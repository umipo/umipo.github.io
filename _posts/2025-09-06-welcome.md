**Welcome to My Blog**

Welcome to this space where I'll be sharing thoughts, observations, and reflections from my current chapter working and living in Bhutan.

After years in academia, most recently as a PhD student at MIT, I've found myself in a transition period. The shift from academic research to applied project management has offered unexpected insights into how knowledge translates (or doesn't translate) from theory to practice.

I'll be exploring questions that have emerged from this transition: How do we make decisions when the stakes are real rather than theoretical? What's the difference between having knowledge and being genuinely useful? How do we write our own life story, while embedding ourselves in a project larger than oneself?

I will try to grapple with what [Chögyam Trungpa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%B6gyam_Trungpa) calls "spiritual materialism", the ways our pursuit of meaning can become another form of acquisition. Other posts will contain reflections on project management and collaboration - what ways of working I've found to promote or hinder successful work.

I hope you'll find something useful here.
