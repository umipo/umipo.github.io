Hello! I'm Daum Kim (한글: 김다움; 中文: 金茶莲; 日本語: キム ダウミ), and I'm a Korea-born, China-raised, and Japan-based East Asian.

Currently, I serve as the Project Director at the [Henkaku Center](https://henkaku.org), where I oversee antidisciplinary research projects and communications. I also work as Deputy Architect at the [Digital Architecture Lab](https://dalab.xyz), and as Director of Creative Content at the [Gelephu Mindfulness City](https://gmc.bt), Bhutan's new special administrative region, where I lead digital media strategy and branding. Across these roles, I work closely with Joi Ito to bridge academia, industry, and public service in designing systems that foster intercultural interactions and community building.

Before my projects with Joi, I spent five years managing global social media strategy at the [International Olympic Committee](https://www.olympics.com/) and the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games Committee.

I also enjoy sharing experiences through video storytelling. In my free time, I work as a Freelance Reporter for NHK World and co-run [Ethnic Neighbourhoods](https://www.youtube.com/EthnicNeighborhoods), a YouTube channel I started with my colleague Hiro to celebrate ethnic communities around the world.

I hold a Ph.D. in Media and Governance from Keio University, where my research explored how networked narratives can either reduce or amplify prejudice on social media. I'm also honored to be an R. J. Chao Memorial Asian Scholar alumna of the [Bai Xian Asia Institute](https://www.bxai.org/).

And in case you're wondering - my GitHub ID and social handles, umipo, come from a nickname my dad gave me when I was six, back when he set up my very first email address. :)
