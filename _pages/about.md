Hi! This is Daum. I'm currently based in Thimphu, Bhutan working as a Project Manager for [Gelephu Mindfulness City](https://gmc.bt/). I am also a Visiting Researcher at the [Henkaku Center at Chiba Institute of Technology](https://www.henkaku.center/en).

Before this, I was a PhD student working with [Prof. Rebecca Saxe](https://saxelab.mit.edu/) in the [Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT](https://bcs.mit.edu/). I worked on better understanding the computational mechanisms underlying visual attention, particularly in preverbal infants. To do [this research](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.21.609039v2.abstract), I used tools from developmental psychology, computational cognitive science and optimal decision theory. I also worked on [automated tools for infant behavioral testing](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2024-97072-001.html) to accelerate the study of the developing mind and make it more robust.

I did my MSc in [Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/) and my BSc in Cognitive Neuroscience at [University College Utrecht](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/university-college-utrecht/about-ucu). 

After each degree program, I make a point of taking a gap year. So far, I spent this time as a visiting researcher at [Hitachi R&D in Japan](https://www.hitachi.com/rd/about/location/cer/index.html), volunteering at a [school in the north of India](https://lamdonjamyangschool.org/) and studying Vipassana meditation (as taught by [S.N. Goenka](https://www.dhamma.org/en-US/index)). Before that, I grew up in Münster and Göttingen, two beautiful unversity towns in Germany.
